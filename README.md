This project involves a comprehensive analysis of a student mental health survey dataset. The project identifies key indicators such as stress levels, sleep quality, physical activity, and the use of counseling services that affect students' mental well-being. It highlights the challenges students face, including high stress levels in the 18-22 age group, poor sleep quality correlating with increased anxiety, and financial stress, particularly among medical students. The findings emphasize the importance of enhancing support systems, like counseling services, to improve students' mental health and academic success. This project demonstrates the ability to analyze complex datasets and derive actionable insights to address real-world challenges.
